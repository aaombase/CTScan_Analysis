# CT Scan Analyzer Platform

An advanced web application for uploading, analyzing, and reporting on CT scans, featuring role-based access for doctors and patients.

## Project Overview

This platform facilitates the stroke detection workflow, allowing:

-   **Doctors and Radiologists** to upload CT scans, trigger AI analysis (mocked), view heatmaps/results, and generate diagnostic reports.
-   **Patients** to view their scan history, status, and download final reports.

The application is built with a modern React frontend and an Express.js backend.

## Architecture

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vite
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mock Data Layer (extensible to MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd CTScan_Analysis
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install

    # Install frontend dependencies
    cd ..
